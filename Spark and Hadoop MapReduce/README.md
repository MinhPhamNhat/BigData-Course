# Spark and Hadoop MapReduce

## The Five Key Differences of Apache Spark vs Hadoop MapReduce
1. Apache Spark is potentially 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce.
2. Apache Spark utilizes RAM and isn’t tied to Hadoop’s two-stage paradigm.
3. Apache Spark works well for smaller data sets that can all fit into a server's RAM.
4. Hadoop is more cost effective processing massive data sets.
5. Apache Spark is now more popular that Hadoop MapReduce.
